This project's goal is to create a Data Visualization dash in Tableau, by means of examining raw data from a CSV file, importing this data into a fitting into a Database Schema (MySQL) which will allows us to ask and answer questions through Queries, from here we can load the retrieved information we want/need to create a Dashboard.
